# TapsOfFire

Taps of Fire is an implementation of http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net'>Frets on Fire (Guitar Hero like game) for Android platform. 
It supports plain FOF songs (just put them in /sdcard/TapsOfFire/songs).

If you started to get crashes in 1.0.3 version, please try to upgrade to 1.0.5 (Droid/Milestone version)

Well, I fixed crash for Droid/Milestone, and that was easy. 
The hard part is fixing b/w notes. I can only guess here. So, Droid/Milestone users, please download 1.0.5 version, and report results in the feedback thread or by email. 

There is no point for all others to update, yet. I will start fixing bugs after b/w issue on Droid. And the first thing I plan to fix is to place .nomedia files in the songs and cache folders. 

I encourage you to go to the Issues tab and: * Leave your feedback in Feedback thread * Vote for and comment on a feature that you would like to see implemented * Suggest your own feature * Report a bug
