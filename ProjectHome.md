<font color='red'>Taps of Fire</font> is an implementation of <a href='http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net'>Frets on Fire</a> (Guitar Hero like game) for Android platform.
<br />It supports plain FOF songs (just put them in /sdcard/TapsOfFire/songs).

**If you started to get crashes in 1.0.3 version, please try to upgrade to 1.0.5 (Droid/Milestone version)**

**Well, I fixed crash for Droid/Milestone, and that was easy.** <br />
The hard part is fixing b/w notes. I can only guess here. So, Droid/Milestone users, please download 1.0.5 version, and report results in the feedback thread or by email. <br />
<br />
**There is no point for all others to update, yet.** I will start fixing bugs after b/w issue on Droid. And the first thing I plan to fix is to place .nomedia files in the songs and cache folders.
<br />
